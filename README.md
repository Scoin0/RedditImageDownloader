###So you might be asking... Why did you make this?
***

Well, I post a lot of anime images to a few Discords and downloading each image took to much time. I thought I could have it done in a much easier way. So I made this. 
I by no means works well but it gets the job done nicely. 

You can download the jar in the Downloads section on the sidebar. The bat file you need is included in this repo. You just gotta copy it. The program makes
the folder and file you need as well. 

* If at all you cannot download images or get stuck with '>' appearing close the program and try again. It usually works after that.
